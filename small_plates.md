## Compassion
- This parable—like all parables﻿—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace. It underscores the thought I heard many years ago that surely the thing God enjoys most about being God is the thrill of being merciful, especially to those who don’t expect it and often feel they don’t deserve it.<sup>1</sup>

## Endure To The End
- "Model drift" It's a hard pill to swallow that what works today may not work tomorrow. Priorities remain even when life changes, and the implementation of the priorities is what differs over time. This brings new meaning to me thinking about "daily bread"<sup>1</sup>

## Faith
- Moroni's (almost) final words are spent testifying that miracles are real and exist as a function of personal faith. This is spoken in the context of loneliness and surrounded by sorrow and wickedness. But he knows that faith in God can turn it all around—even his dire scene can be entirely corrected and perfected by God through faith<sup>1</sup>

### Faith Sources
1) Mormon 9:20 (15-21)

## Humility
- Humbling themselves before God gave them the power of God with them<sup>1</sup>

### Humility Sources
1) 1 Nephi 13:16

## Music
- Thinking about the hymns that make me want to weep happy tears. It's not because of the rhetoric or excellent composition by these trained songwriters. It's because of the testimony in them of truth and joy of Jesus Christ. I need to remember more often that the spirit is what determines the efficacy of testimony, not skill or grandeur.<sup>1</sup>

### Music Sources
1) Hymn 220 Lord, I Would Follow Thee

## Relationship With Jesus
- You may have full faith in the Jesus that performed the mighty atonement years ago but does Christ ever seem to you too distant, too inaccessible, and too impersonal to ever move from being a picture on the wall or a statue or a name in the scriptures to becoming your personal, practical, and daily Savior?<sup>1</sup>

## Repentance
- The moment we stop hardening our hearts and repent, it becomes our "day of salvation" and "immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you"<sup>1</sup>

### Repentance Sources
1) Alma 34:31

## Temple
- You are never lost when you can see the temple. The temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos. It is an eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the “mist of darkness.” It is the house of the Lord. Understanding the eternal nature of the temple will draw you to your family; understanding the eternal nature of the family will draw you to the temple.<sup>1</sup>

## Time
- We show our love to the Lord when we put Him above “these,” and “these” can be anyone, any activity, or anything that displaces Him from being the most important influence in our lives. There will never be enough time in a day, a week, a month, or a year to get done all we want or need to accomplish. Part of the test of mortality is to use the precious resource of time for what is most important for our eternal good and to let go of those things that are less important.<sup>1</sup>
