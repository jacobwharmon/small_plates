## Body Of Christ
- A huge part, maybe aside from the sacrament the entire part of the church, is the bearing, mourning, comforting. We need to invest in the sharing and helping. Thoughts of "I have nothing to offer, no words, no experience" is wrong. Because we take upon ourselves the name of Christ. He will help us help them. The words will come if we try. Our ward family is important and even if we think we bring nothing to the table, the only thing that the table needs is a willing heart<sup>1</sup>

## Compassion
- This parable—like all parables﻿—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace. It underscores the thought I heard many years ago that surely the thing God enjoys most about being God is the thrill of being merciful, especially to those who don’t expect it and often feel they don’t deserve it.<sup>1</sup>

## Endure To The End
- "Model drift" It's a hard pill to swallow that what works today may not work tomorrow. Priorities remain even when life changes, and the implementation of the priorities is what differs over time. This brings new meaning to me thinking about "daily bread"<sup>1</sup>
- Typically after experiences full of the spirit where we feel we can see ourselves in God's presence….it gets rough. The converted of the wicked Zoramites (those mostly impoverished) after joining their testimonies of the savior with Amulek's in chapter 34, in 35:6 they were exiled from their home. Faith and obedience to the gospel is not some promise that our life will end up a certain way. It is not a promise of wealth, or comfort, or health, or anything this world can offer. Faith and obedience to the gospel is so we can become something, not have something. It is a promise of peace, joy, family, and a knowledge that all unfairness in this life will be made whole by Christ.<sup>2</sup>

### Endure To The End Sources

2) Alma 34 & 35 (and many others)

## Faith
- Moroni's (almost) final words are spent testifying that miracles are real and exist as a function of personal faith. This is spoken in the context of loneliness and surrounded by sorrow and wickedness. But he knows that faith in God can turn it all around—even his dire scene can be entirely corrected and perfected by God through faith<sup>1</sup>

### Faith Sources
1) Mormon 9:20 (15-21)

## Humility
- Humbling themselves before God gave them the power of God with them<sup>1</sup>
- Humility is not merely the absence of pride. Humility is willingness to trust and follow the Lord. Be thou humble … and the Lord thy God will lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.<sup>2</sup>
- Humility is teachableness—an ability to realize that all virtues and abilities are not concentrated in one’s self. . . Humility is never accusing nor contentious. . . Humility is repentant and seeks not to justify its follies. It is forgiving others in the realization that there may be errors of the same kind or worse [that we ourselves commit]<sup>3,4</sup>

## Judgement
- Most of the time "righteous judgement" means no judgement<sup>1</sup>

### Judgement Sources
1) Thoughts 28 Jan 2024

## Knowledge
- "Add to virtue knowledge" — why knowledge on our way to Charity? The more you know about God, the more you understand His expectations & promises and the easier it is to feel his charity for us. The more you know about others, the easier it is to give them that patience & charity that we ought.<sup>1</sup>

### Knowledge Sources
1) 2 Peter 1:5

## Living Water
- Christ is very clear telling us that He is the living water. It is very clear that if we drink of His water we will never thirst, but have eternal life. What is less clear is "how one drinks of His water". Drinking water is vital and we become weak very soon after we stop—even within the very day we stop. So it functions well as an analogy for the minimum frequency we ought to study and ponder and be near Christ.<sup>1</sup>

### Living Water Sources
1) John 4

## Love
- You may have heard the saying “Love the sinner; hate the sin.” Do we spend enough time on the first half of that invitation? Jesus tells us to “love one another” (John 13:34) and forgive “seventy times seven” (see Matthew 18:22). Instead of spending time trying to identify and hate another person’s sin, we can use that energy to nourish relationships with our fellow brothers and sisters. We like to use the saying “Love the sinner; invite them to dinner!”<sup>1</sup>

## Music
- Thinking about the hymns that make me want to weep happy tears. It's not because of the rhetoric or excellent composition by these trained songwriters. It's because of the testimony in them of truth and joy of Jesus Christ. I need to remember more often that the spirit is what determines the efficacy of testimony, not skill or grandeur.<sup>1</sup>

### Music Sources
1) Hymn 220 Lord, I Would Follow Thee

## Peace
- Liberty Jail demonstrates that adversity is not evidence of the Lord’s disfavor nor a withdrawal of His blessings. "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you." Peace in the world is not promised or assured until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. However, personal peace can be achieved despite the anger, contention, and division that blight and corrupt our world today. It has never been more important to seek personal peace. DC 59:23 But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world<sup>1</sup>

## Relationship With Jesus
- You may have full faith in the Jesus that performed the mighty atonement years ago but does Christ ever seem to you too distant, too inaccessible, and too impersonal to ever move from being a picture on the wall or a statue or a name in the scriptures to becoming your personal, practical, and daily Savior?<sup>1</sup>

### Relationship With Jesus Sources

## Repentance
- The moment we stop hardening our hearts and repent, it becomes our "day of salvation" and "immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you"<sup>1</sup>

### Repentance Sources
1) Alma 34:31

## Scripture Study
- We say that the scriptures contain the answers to every question because the scriptures can lead us to every answer. Even though the scriptures [may] contain no words to answer our specific personal question, a prayerful study of the scriptures will help us obtain such answers. This is because scripture study will make us susceptible to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. The scriptures will help us resolve all of our personal questions because by reading them we invite and qualify ourselves for the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, which will guide us into all truth<sup>1</sup>
- 2 Timothy 3:2-4 the world will be wicked. Feeling depressed by the reality of the prophecy in the verses above he wondered, what can we do? 2 Timothy 3:14-15 "the holy scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith. The scriptures are the anchor, the compass, the shield, the corrector, the instructor, and the perfecter for all men in all times<sup>2</sup>

## Temple
- You are never lost when you can see the temple. The temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos. It is an eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the “mist of darkness.” It is the house of the Lord. Understanding the eternal nature of the temple will draw you to your family; understanding the eternal nature of the family will draw you to the temple.<sup>1</sup>

### Temple Sources

## Time
- We show our love to the Lord when we put Him above “these,” and “these” can be anyone, any activity, or anything that displaces Him from being the most important influence in our lives. There will never be enough time in a day, a week, a month, or a year to get done all we want or need to accomplish. Part of the test of mortality is to use the precious resource of time for what is most important for our eternal good and to let go of those things that are less important.<sup>1</sup>

### Time Sources

## Trust
- Hold on to the first article of faith, even if something else is uncertain. And while you wait, wait upon the Lord, which includes trusting in His timing as well as in His promises. And while we wait, we should busy ourselves with service. Again and again, Jesus taught and demonstrated the power of service to others.<sup>1</sup>

### Trust Sources
1) https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks/coming-closer-to-jesus-christ/

## Trust In God
- The Nephites had faith to flee when the Lord told them, or fight when the Lord told them . Trusting that His ways were always the correct ways, and they would prosper if they followed<sup>1</sup>

### Trust In God Sources
1) Alma 48:15-16

## Weakness
- Similarly, when the Apostle Paul sought to be healed from the “thorn in the flesh” that buffeted him the Lord declined to heal him. Paul later wrote that the Lord explained, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness”. Paul obediently responded that he would “rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me … for when I am weak, then am I strong”. Some weaknesses will be our companions through our entire mortality to be a reminder to seek the Savior's healing power<sup>1,2</sup>
