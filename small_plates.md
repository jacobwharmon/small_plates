## Compassion
- This parable—like all parables﻿—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace. It underscores the thought I heard many years ago that surely the thing God enjoys most about being God is the thrill of being merciful, especially to those who don’t expect it and often feel they don’t deserve it.<sup>1</sup>

## Music
- Thinking about the hymns that make me want to weep happy tears. It's not because of the rhetoric or excellent composition by these trained songwriters. It's because of the testimony in them of truth and joy of Jesus Christ. I need to remember more often that the spirit is what determines the efficacy of testimony, not skill or grandeur.<sup>1</sup>

## Time
- We show our love to the Lord when we put Him above “these,” and “these” can be anyone, any activity, or anything that displaces Him from being the most important influence in our lives. There will never be enough time in a day, a week, a month, or a year to get done all we want or need to accomplish. Part of the test of mortality is to use the precious resource of time for what is most important for our eternal good and to let go of those things that are less important.<sup>1</sup>
