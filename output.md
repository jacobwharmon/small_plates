## Music
- Thinking about the hymns that make me want to weep happy tears. It's not because of the rhetoric or excellent composition by these trained songwriters. It's because of the testimony in them of truth and joy of Jesus Christ. I need to remember more often that the spirit is what determines the efficacy of testimony, not skill or grandeur.<sup>1</sup>
